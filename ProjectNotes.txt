Response Normalization Strategies
-> In order to produce a consistently structured error response from all services, an error handling middleware can be defined
    -> User-defined error handling middleware functions must accept four arguments in Express: err, req, res, next
    -> In general, the goal of an error handler is to handle different types of incoming errors, and yield some sort of standardized error response
-> We can also utilize Express's built-in error handling mechanism (invoking the next() callback in asynchronous route handlers)
    -> As of Express 5.0, asynchronous route handlers and middleware will automatically invoke the next() function if they reject or throw an error
        -> Otherwise, if no errors are thrown, the next() function will be invoked with the default error object (if one exists)
-> Type interfaces, or abstract classes can be defined to set up requirements for subclasses
    -> Abstract classes are classes which contain abstract methods signatures and cannot be instantiated
    -> Any classes derived from an abstract class must implement/define all methods specified in the base class
    -> Abstract classes in JavaScript closely resemble the behaviour of interfaces in Java

Mongo No-SQL Databases
-> In order to ensure that each microservice is entirely self-contained, we will create a separate database table for each service
-> Services cannot directly access other services' databases, but can indirectly retrieve information from the event broker
-> Since we are working with MongoDB within a Kubernetes cluster, deployment and service configuration files must be provided for each database instance
    -> We can reference the official MongoDB image on Docker Hub when specifying the containers running within the pods
-> To improve application security, all user passwords should be hashed before being stored in the database (as opposed to being stored in plaintext)
    -> Consequently, malicious users will be unable to view the actual passwords if they happen to gain access to the database
-> <schemaName>.pre("save", cb) can be used to execute the specified callback before a new user document is saved to the database
    -> Mongoose pre hooks aim to atomize the model logic, and effectively handle the presence of asynchronous middlewares
-> <schemaName>.statics|methods.<method_name> can be used to define instance methods associated with the given schema
    -> All instances of this model (i.e. documents) will be able to access these methods at any time via the dot notation

Authentication Strategies
-> Handling user authentication in the context of microservices is quite challenging and complex
-> Option 1: individual services rely on a central authentication service
    -> Send cookies/JWT data in a synchronous request to each microservice
    -> Downsides: heavy reliance on the authentication service, no protection if it goes down
    -> Variant: rely on the authentication service as a gateway (authenticate incoming requests before forwarding request to intended service)
        -> Allows for un-authenticated requests to be proactively blocked
-> Option 2: individual services are able to directly/natively authenticate users (no reliance on external auth service)
    -> Encapsulate authentication logic within each microservice
    -> Downsides: duplicating authentication logic, making an auth-related change within one service does not transfer to other services
        -> This auth-related discrepancy between services can introduce significant issues
            -> E.g. One service bans a malicious users account, but the other services are not aware of this access/permission change
            -> Consequently, the malicious user would still be able to successfully authenticate with their previously obtained cookie/JWT
    -> Solution: set expiry limits (assign released cookies/JWTs a finite lifetime before they are no longer viable)
        -> If the expiry time has passed, the user will need to re-authenticate before accessing the application
-> Common authentication mechanisms:
    -> Cookies: server includes an arbitrary cookie string in the headers field of the response object
        -> The browser can then attach the cookie in future requests to the server domain
    -> JSON Web Tokens: JWTs are encoded out of an arbitrary payload (with a secret key/passphrase), and can be included in the cookie or authorization field of request objects
    -> TDLR; cookies are a transport mechanism automatically managed by the browser, whereas JWTs are strictly authentication-centric mechanisms that must be managed manually
-> In server-side rendering (i.e., NextJS-based React applications), cookies must be utilized to communicate authorization information during the initial request to the server
    -> All other methods fail to transfer this information in time; preventing the server from constructing the appropriate HTML code
-> Cookie-session is a cookie-based session middleware (node module) which stores session data within a client-side cookie
    -> Consequently, the cookie-session library does not require any server-side resources
-> A Secret object can be created in a Kubernetes cluster to store sensitive information
    -> All pods contained within the cluster are able to access secrets
    -> Caveat: explicit references to desired secrets must be declared in the relevant deployment config files
        -> These declarations reveal/expose the secret object(s) as local environment variables within the linked pods/containers

Client-Side vs Server-Side Data Fetching
-> In the browser (i.e., client-side), data can be fetched from any service without additional configuration
-> Conversely, attempting to fetch external data while server-side is problematic
    -> By default, the server cannot access data residing in a different pod
-> There are two possible workarounds to this issue:
    -> 1) Reach out directly to the desired service - insert its name into the domain of the fetch request
        -> E.g., http://auth-srv/api/users/current-user (assuming service is named "auth-srv")
    -> 2) Reach out to ingress-nginx with the current host name (e.g., "ticketing.ca")
        -> Ingress-nginx will then automatically forward the request to the appropriate service
        -> URL syntax for cross-namespace communication: http://<SERVICE_NAME>.<NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local
            -> Note: use <k get service -n NAMESPACE> to retrieve the services located within the specified namespace

Data Fetching Methods
https://blog.logrocket.com/data-fetching-next-js-getserversideprops-getstaticprops/#understanding-getinitialprops
-> GetInitialProps() is executed on the server-side (during a hard refresh or equivalent action), and on the client-side (when navigating between different pages of the same application)
-> GetServerSideProps() is only executed on the server-side
    -> Reduces duplicate data fetching, and provides better predictability of server-side data fetching
-> Both of these methods can be used to fetch data on the server-side before rendering a page
    -> 1) Server fetches data from an external source (by invoking the data fetching methods associated with the current component)
    -> 2) Server passes the fetched data to the component as props
    -> 2) Server pre-renders the page (i.e., component) with the fetched data
    -> 3) Server delivers the complete HTML page to the client (i.e., browser)
-> Server-Side Rendering (SSR) reduces initial page load times and improves Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the application
